# MCMC
This is a simulation for the 2D Ising model. In the first you can play around with the lattice size, and how the spins change after a certain number of iterations. The second is to analyze the magentization for each lattice in a given temperature range. This project was done for a seminar talk on theoretical statistical physics at the university of Heidelber under supervision of Professor Dr. Wolshin.
